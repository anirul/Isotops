A simple puzzler in Unreal 4 (based on real nuclear physics).

The idea is to be able to create various nuclei by just pushing neutrons/protons into the nuclei. You will be ablt to see in a screen your player collection of nuclei (stable?). The player can start from any nuclei he has in store and add to it to create further ones.

```ascii
Example:

        1               0               2                 -
          H     +         n        =      He       +    e
        3               1               4
```

This would remove a tritium from your collection and add an Helium.
